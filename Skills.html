            <h2 class="subtitle">Intro</h2>
            <p1 id="para">A lot goes into getting food to our plates, and with technology advancing rapidly, the future of sustainable farming and animal nutrition lies in big tech. At Nutreco, I gained valuable insight into how impactful technology can be in shaping the future of feed production and distribution.</p1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">What is Nutreco?</h2>
            <p2 id="para2">Nutreco is a leader in animal nutrition and plans on using technology to feed the
                growing population in a sustainable manner. There are several locations across
                Canada and internationally, in Ontario the two locations are in St Marys and
                Puslinch.<br><br>
                In Nutreco, everyone plays an important role in ensuring customers produce as
                much feed as possible for Feeding the Future. There are many roles in technology
                that play a huge part in that vision as well. <br><br>
                Nutreco offers a wide range of services/products with animal feed being at the core
                of most of them.</p2>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Job Description</h2>
                <p4 id="para4">As a Project Coordinator intern, I began my role by learning Amino, a predictive ordering software designed to replace Excel sheets in customizing and delivering animal feed. Initially, it was challenging to grasp Amino's complexity, especially with no prior knowledge of broiler chickens and feed delivery. However, after familiarizing myself with the application and its API-driven communication for deliveries and orders, I was able to thoroughly test its functionality, using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to summarize order data points.<br><br>
                    Throughout my work with Amino, I developed a comprehensive list of test cases to assess its various functionalities. When I encountered bugs or issues, I presented them to the team and provided detailed explanations. As I gained more experience, I began training the regional team in Ontario, facilitating a smooth transition from Excel to Amino. This involved teaching a team with diverse technical abilities how to navigate and use the application effectively. During the training sessions, we conducted User Acceptance Testing, gathering UI concerns, feedback, and input useful for change management specialists.<br><br>
                    A significant portion of my work involved creating detailed documentation for troubleshooting and using Amino's features. These documents were then incorporated into a Copilot AI Bot to assist users with their questions about Amino. Testing the AI Bot's responses to prompts offered a valuable learning experience, especially in understanding how different writing formats influence the bot's ability to answer general "how-to" questions and its challenges with more vague, open-ended inquiries. My goal for the Amino Bot is to add more in-depth explanations about what Amino is, why it is important, and how to best approach it, including alternative terminology based on regional variations.

We haven’t progressed much in User Acceptance Testing yet, so I plan to focus more on that area moving forward.
