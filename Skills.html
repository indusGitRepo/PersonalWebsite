        <p id="para1">Hi my name is Inderjeet and welcome to my website! Source code for this will be linked to my git. </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Intro</h2>
            <p1 id="para">A lot goes behind how food gets to the plate, and as technology is rapidly advancing, big tech on farms is the future of sustainability and animal nutrition.</p1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">What is Nutreco?</h2>
            <p2 id="para2">Nutreco is a leader in animal nutrition and plans on using technology to feed the
                growing population in a sustainable manner. There are several locations across
                Canada and internationally, in Ontario the two locations are in St Marys and
                Puslinch.<br><br>
                In Nutreco, everyone plays an important role in ensuring customers produce as
                much feed as possible for Feeding the Future. There are many roles in technology
                that play a huge part in that vision as well. There are Full Stack developers that
                ensure … As well as Product Owners and Product Managers that foresee …<br><br>
                Nutreco offers a wide range of services/products with animal feed being at the core
                of most of them.</p2>
            <h2 class="subtitle">My Goals at Nutreco</h2>
            <p3 id="para3">
                I had set a list of goals both technical and non-technical, to ensure that I can learn
                as much as possible during my time as an intern.<br><br>
                My goals included the following,<br><br>
                1. Learn how the cloud-based application Amino works and how to use it effectively
                with M3.<br><br>
                2. Communicating the bigger picture of Amino as well as its finer details to an
                audience of a wide range of technical prophecies.<br><br>
                3. Working on a real Project meant meeting deadlines – more specifically providing
                training on how to use Amino during summer and start UAT (User Acceptance
                Testing) in fall to go live by the end of the year.<br><br>
                4. Getting provinces across Canada on one application can prove to be difficult if
                regional business practices and nuisances are taken into consideration. So, learning
                and applying that into my day to day work was important.<br><br>
                5. Understanding the supply chain of delivering feed to birds, and the greater picture of
                big tech on multiple sites.<br><br>
                These goals are central to my current job’s day to day, and beyond that as well, as they will
                continue to help me in future positions. More specifically, learning how to articulate
                technical concepts to both tech savvy and non-technical professionals. That skill will
                provide me the confidence in future roles that will be more technical.<br><br>
                Learning how to read errors that APIs can throw and how to interpret those errors to quickly
                think of solutions, has been beneficial for practicing how to solve problems. Having
                different kinds of methods for solving problems would be crucial in a technical position
                such as a developer. Documenting solved errors/problems has also been an efficient way
                to develop good practices for debugging.<br><br>
                I also focused on how to look for information in the correct places. Working with such a
                complex application there is a lot of documentation available, however, knowing which
                pieces of information is useful for my situation can save time and increase productivity. The
                skill of knowing how to search for information given a lot of documents provides me
                confidence in learning new technologies and concepts. As many companies tend to write
                long and detailed documentation about their products and software, knowing how to go
                through that is essential.<br><br>
                Outside of the Amino and M3 applications, I had the opportunity to learn more about
                Microsoft Power Apps, Power Automate, Copilot Studios, and Dataverse. Exploring these
                topics through assigned learnings diversified my technical experience during my coop
                placement thus far. I want to be able to work with these tools for smaller projects so that I
                can apply them to a real-world situation. This would be an interesting experience as a
                Computer Science student so that I am able to compare creating applications/solutions to
                problems via programming vs. low code solutions.<br><br>
                Lastly, a huge chunk of my work involved creating documentation for troubleshooting
                problems and using Aminos features. These documents were then attached to a Copilot AI
                Bot, to answer user questions about Amino. Testing to see how to an AI Bot reacts to
                prompts as someone who wrote the documents was a great learning opportunity. I learned
                what formats of writing work best for AI to answer general “How to” questions, and how it
                has trouble answering more vague and open-ended questions. My goal for the Amino Bot is
                to add bigger and more in-depth paragraphs about what Amino is, why it is important, and
                how to best approach it. As well as, additional terminology users may use depending on
                the region that means the same thing across Canada, so that knowledge of Amino terms is
                not necessary to ask the Amino Bot questions.<br><br></p3>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
            <p4 id="para4">It’s very important to be aware of what goes on behind the scenes of getting food to
                consumers. It takes a lot of people across many professions to ensure quality food is sold.
                Using technology to optimize and enhance that process is the future of animal nutrition.</p4>
