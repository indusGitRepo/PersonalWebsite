            <h2><a href="AboutMe.html" class="subtitle">About Me</a></h2>
            <p1 id="para">This page highlights my academic journey, focusing on my studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Guelph. You'll find insights into some of my favorite courses, which have fueled my passion for problem-solving! Beyond academics, this page also gives a glimpse into what I enjoy doing in my free time.
                <br><br>Looking ahead, I share my goals for the future—driven by a desire to continue learning, apply my skills in innovative ways, and design solutions that make a meaningful impact. Whether in technology, mathematics, or any field where challenges exist, I’m eager to contribute my knowledge and creativity.
                </p1>
            <h2><a href="Skills.html" class="subtitle" id="mobile">My Skills and Experiences</a></h2>
            <p2 id="para2">This page provides an in-depth overview of my work experiences, where I reflect on the goals I set for myself at the beginning of each role and the strategies I developed to achieve them. I share my plans of action, detailing how I approached challenges and navigated my responsibilities to meet what was required of me.
                <br><br>Throughout my experiences, I evaluate how well I accomplished these goals, varying from where I thought I did well and areas I could have improved more on and how. Each role has been a valuable opportunity to draw out both technical and non-technical skills. I also discuss my abilities in areas like programming, technical writing, project management, and problem-solving.
                <br><br>This page showcases my growth and the continuous development of skills that are essential in both my academic and professional journey.

            <h2><a href="Projects.html" class="subtitle">Projects</a></h2>
            <p3 id="para3">My projects highlight my passion for programming and act as a way to look back on previous work as I hope to continue improving. Showcasing a diverse array of skills and technologies, from front-end Web Development to Full Stack solutions.
                <br><br>Not only does each project highlight different technical tools, but also my problem-solving abilities and understanding of different programming styles. One project focused on Object Oriented Programming, which meant refactoring code to ensure it was clean and reusable, as well as managing a larger project.
                <br><br>Ultimately, these projects are a way for me to set goals for my future on things I can improve on and act as a foundation for future work that is more innovative and challenging.
