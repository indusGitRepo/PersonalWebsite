            <h1 id="para">My name is Inderjeet Gill, and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Guelph with a minor in Mathematics. I chose Computer Science and Math because I love solving problems, and I plan to continue exploring how those two fields of study are connected. At my university, Iâ€™ve learned the importance of community, especially as a woman, so I thoroughly enjoyed being an executive member of Guelph Women in Computer Science and seeing the impact a safe space can have on marginalized members of the community. The biggest takeaway from my educational experience thus far has been how far curiosity can take me, and I want to learn as much as possible in the remainder of my degree.</h1>
            <h4 id="para4">Some of my favorite courses I have taken include, CIS*2750 Software Systems Development and Integration which is an amazing opportunity to complete a full-stack project, CIS*2910 Discrete Structures in Computing II is a course that helped me gain a new perspective when approaching and analyzing problems, and lastly, MATH*2270 Applied Differential Equations because I loved using multiple different approaches to solve one problem!</h4>
            <h2 id="para2">In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my friends exploring different cultures, trying out each other's hobbies, and being in nature. I also love theatre and have written many scripts and had roles in plays. For me, that was a fun way to destress from school and be creative!</h2>
            <h3 id="para3">In terms of a professional career, my biggest priority is doing something I love and find challenging. I would love to design solutions for interesting problems through programming and math. I have many work terms left in my cooperative education and aim to try different kinds of roles in tech! </h3>

            <p>These are a few pictures that can best represent my time at my university! I prioritized qaulity time with friends and being outside in nature. I love volunteering for the anual Go Code Girl Event, the two pictures on the bottom are from Go Code Girl 2023 (black shirt) and 2024 (red shirt).</p>
